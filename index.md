# About

> **Service update:** *The {{site.data.keyword.tradeoffanalyticsfull}} service is being deprecated. As of **May 11, 2017**, it will no longer be possible to create a new instance of the service on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. Existing service instances will continue to be supported until **April 11, 2018**.*

The {{site.data.keyword.tradeoffanalyticsfull}} service helps people make better choices when faced with multiple, often conflicting, goals and alternatives. By using mathematical filtering techniques to identify the best candidate options based on different criteria, the service can help users explore the tradeoffs between options to make complex decisions. The service combines smart visualization and analytical recommendations for easy and intuitive exploration of tradeoffs.
{: shortdesc}

Users of a {{site.data.keyword.tradeoffanalyticsshort}} application specify decision criteria by selecting objectives and preferences. Developers of such applications specify the available options and their characteristics. The service filters out less attractive options to encourage users' exploration of the remaining optimal candidates. In this way, the service helps decision makers consider only the goals that matter most and only the best candidates to make a final, informed decision.

[{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.watson}} Explorer ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://www.ibm.com/watson/explorer.html){: new_window} combines search and content analytics with unique cognitive computing capabilities that are available through external cloud services such as {{site.data.keyword.watson}} Developer Cloud. The combination helps users find and understand the information they need to work more efficiently and to make better, more confident decisions. The tutorial creates a {{site.data.keyword.tradeoffanalyticsshort}} application in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} and a {{site.data.keyword.tradeoffanalyticsshort}} widget for {{site.data.keyword.watson}} Explorer that uses data indexed by the {{site.data.keyword.watson}} Explorer Engine to provide visual and analytical recommendations about books.
